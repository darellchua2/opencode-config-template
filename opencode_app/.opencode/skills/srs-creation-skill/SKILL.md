## What I do

I provide a structured **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** creation workflow following the **IEEE 830** standard — the recognized BA-to-developer requirements document. The SRS is an **internal** document (audience = development team), distinct from the customer-facing Vision Document.

1. **IEEE 830 SRS Template** — 4-part structure (Introduction / Overall Description / Specific Requirements / Supporting Information) preserving the valuable sections of the prior PRD template (acceptance criteria, NFRs, MoSCoW priorities, risks) by mapping them into the IEEE structure
2. **docs/srs/ Naming Convention** — draft files (`SRS-draft-{slug}.md`) renamed to ticket-keyed files (`SRS-{key}.md`) after ticket creation
3. **PLAN Back-Linkage** — bidirectional traceability between SRS and PLAN files
4. **Discovery Interview Workflow** — prompt-first flow that gathers content section-by-section with user confirmation

> **Back-compat:** the legacy triggers "create prd", "product requirement", "product requirement document", "product doc", "PRD" route to **this** SRS skill. PRD was the wrong label for BA→dev handoff; SRS (IEEE 830) is the proper-software-house standard.

## When to use me

Use this skill when:
- A feature needs **internal requirements engineering** for the development team (NOT a customer-facing doc — that is `vision-creation-skill`)
- Someone says "create srs", "software requirements", "functional spec", "feature spec", "specification", "write srs"
- You want a structured artifact that feeds into the PLAN file via `ticket-creation-subagent`
- The customer-facing Vision is signed off and must be translated into developer-ready requirements
- Reviewing/updating an existing SRS

**Trigger phrases**: "create srs", "software requirements", "functional spec", "feature spec", "specification", "write srs", "srs doc" — plus back-compat "create prd", "product requirement", "product doc", "PRD"

## Audience

The SRS is **internal — for the development team**. It encodes tradeoffs, non-goals, MoSCoW priorities, build-vs-buy rationale, performance targets, and traceability that you would NOT put in front of a customer. The customer-facing equivalent is the Vision Document (`vision-creation-skill`).

## Related

- **`requirements-specialist-subagent`** — the agent that authors the SRS (this skill is its template)
- **`vision-creation-skill`** — the upstream customer-facing doc; the signed Vision feeds INTO the SRS
- **`interactive-document-rendering-skill`** — shared HTML + DOCX rendering standard (snapshot HTML for SRS)
- **`ticket-creation-subagent`** — auto-detects draft SRS in `docs/srs/` during Full workflow, renames to ticket key, links in PLAN header
- **`ticket-plan-workflow-skill`** — downstream consumer; SRS feeds into the PLAN file
- **`xlsx-specialist-skill` / `xlsx-specialist-subagent`** — peer tabular deliverables (RTM, data dictionary)
- **`verification-loop-skill`** — acceptance-criteria alignment between SRS and implementation

## SRS Template (IEEE 830)

Every SRS follows the IEEE 830 four-part structure. The header links to the PLAN file (filled when a ticket is created). Valuable content from the prior PRD template is preserved by mapping into the IEEE structure.

### Header

```markdown
# SRS: {Feature Name}

**Status**: Draft | In Review | Approved
**Author**: {name}
**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Vision**: docs/vision/VISION-{slug}.md _(upstream customer-facing doc, if one exists)_
**PLAN**: PLANS/PLAN-{key}.md _(filled when ticket is created)_
```

## Part 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Describe the problem this feature solves and why it matters now.

```markdown
## 1.1 Purpose

{What problem exists today? Who is affected? What is the cost of not solving it?}

**Example**: Users cannot reset their password if they lose access to their
registered email. Support receives ~50 tickets/month for manual password resets,
averaging 2 business days to resolve.
```

### 1.2 Scope

Define what is in and out of scope — explicit non-goals prevent scope creep.

```markdown
## 1.2 Scope

### In scope
- {Deliverable 1}
- {Deliverable 2}

### Out of scope (non-goals)
- {Explicitly excluded — may be future work}
- {What this feature deliberately does NOT do}
```

### 1.3 Definitions & Acronyms

```markdown
## 1.3 Definitions & Acronyms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| {term} | {definition} |
```

### 1.4 References

```markdown
## 1.4 References

- {Link/title — related Vision doc, design doc, research, competitor analysis}
- {Issue/ticket link}
```

### 1.5 Overview

One paragraph outlining how the rest of the SRS is organized.

## Part 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective (Background / Context)

```markdown
## 2.1 Product Perspective

{What led to this problem? What existing systems or decisions are relevant?
What prior attempts (if any) were made?}
```

### 2.2 Product Functions (Goals)

```markdown
## 2.2 Product Functions

- {Explicitly out of scope}
```

### 2.3 User Characteristics (Personas & User Stories)

Identify who benefits and express requirements from their perspective.

```markdown
## 2.3 User Characteristics

### Personas
#### Persona 1: {Name} — {Role}
- **Context**: {When/where do they interact?}
- **Needs**: {What do they need to accomplish?}
- **Pain Points**: {What frustrates them today?}

## Part 3. Specific Requirements

> This is the core of the SRS. Functional requirements carry **MoSCoW** priorities (Must/Should/Could/Won't) and per-requirement acceptance criteria.

### 3.1 External Interfaces

```markdown
## 3.1 External Interfaces

- {User interfaces, hardware, software, communication interfaces}
```

### 3.2 Functional Requirements

```markdown
## 3.2 Functional Requirements

### FR-1: {Requirement Name}
- **Description**: {What the system must do}
- **Priority**: Must | Should | Could | Won't (MoSCoW)
- **Acceptance**: {How to verify this requirement is met}

**Example**:
### FR-1: Password Reset via SMS
- **Description**: Users with a verified phone number can request a password
  reset code via SMS. The code expires after 10 minutes.
- **Priority**: Must
- **Acceptance**: User enters phone → receives 6-digit code → enters code →
  sets new password → redirected to login.
```

### 3.3 Performance Requirements

```markdown
## 3.3 Performance Requirements

- {Metric}: {Target} (e.g. "Password reset page loads < 2s on 3G")
```

### 3.4 Design Constraints

```markdown
## 3.4 Design Constraints

- {Architecture, technology, or standards the design must respect}

### Make vs Buy
- {Build internally vs use third-party — rationale}
```

### 3.5 Software System Attributes (Quality / NFRs)

```markdown
## 3.5 Software System Attributes

### Security
- {Constraint} (e.g. "Reset codes are single-use and hashed at rest")

### Reliability / Availability
- {Target}

### Accessibility
- {Standard} (e.g. "WCAG 2.1 AA compliant")

### Maintainability / Portability
- {Target}
```

### 3.6 Acceptance Criteria (feature-level)

"Done" at the SRS level — complements per-requirement acceptance in 3.2.

```markdown
## 3.6 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {Criterion 1 — high-level, testable}
- [ ] All functional requirements with priority "Must" are implemented
- [ ] All NFRs (3.3–3.5) are validated
```

```markdown
## 4.1 Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| {Metric name} | {Current value} | {Goal} | {How measured} |
```

### 4.2 Risks

```markdown
## 4.2 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| {Risk} | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | {How to mitigate} |
```

### 4.3 Open Questions

```markdown
## 4.3 Open Questions

- [ ] {Question} — **Owner**: {who decides} — **Needed by**: {phase/date}
```

### 4.4 Timeline / Milestones

```markdown
## 4.4 Timeline / Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| {Milestone} | {Date} | {Dependency} |
| Implementation complete | {Date} | Design approved |
```

### 4.5 Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

> **Large tabular artifact — export as .xlsx.** When the RTM exceeds ~15 rows (requirement  test  stakeholder), produce it as `docs/srs/{slug}/SRS-{key}-rtm.xlsx` via `xlsx-specialist` and link it here; keep only the summary inline.

```markdown
## 4.5 Requirements Traceability Matrix

_See docs/srs/{slug}/SRS-{key}-rtm.xlsx for the full matrix._
```

---

## docs/srs/ Naming Convention

### Draft (during planning, before ticket exists)

```
docs/srs/SRS-draft-{kebab-slug}.md
```

- Slug derived from SRS title (e.g. "User Authentication" → `user-authentication`)
- Created by `requirements-specialist-subagent` during the discovery interview
- The `**PLAN**:` field in the header is `_(filled when ticket is created)_`

### Final (after ticket creation)

```
docs/srs/SRS-{ticket-key}.md
```

- Renamed via `git mv` by `ticket-creation-subagent` during Full workflow (preserves git history)
- If the draft was never committed (untracked on the new branch), a plain `mv` + `git add` is used instead

### Bidirectional Linkage

| Direction | Field | Location |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| SRS → PLAN | `**PLAN**: PLANS/PLAN-{key}.md` | SRS header (filled at rename time) |
| PLAN → SRS | `**SRS**: docs/srs/SRS-{key}.md` | PLAN header (injected by ticket-creation-subagent) |

---

## Tabular Artifacts (peer deliverables)

Large tabular deliverables are exported as `.xlsx` via `xlsx-specialist-skill` / `xlsx-specialist-subagent`, **not** inlined:

| Artifact | Path | When |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements Traceability Matrix | `docs/srs/{slug}/SRS-{key}-rtm.xlsx` | >15 requirement rows |
| Data Dictionary | `docs/srs/{slug}/SRS-{key}-data-dictionary.xlsx` | entity/attribute tables |
| Requirement Register | `docs/srs/{slug}/SRS-{key}-register.xlsx` | large requirement lists |

Small tables stay inline in the Markdown. The `.xlsx` files are **peer deliverables linked from the SRS**, never embedded — this keeps a single editable source of truth per artifact.

---

## Rendering

**Render dual outputs per `interactive-document-rendering-skill` (snapshot for SRS):**
- **Interactive HTML** — rendered once at wrap (`docs/srs/{slug}/SRS-{slug}.interactive.html`), snapshot (not living)
- **Word .docx** — formal deliverable for review/sign-off (`docs/srs/SRS-{slug}.docx`), auto-TOC + hyperlinked headers + section page-breaks

**Image routing:** if a referenced diagram/screenshot must be interpreted, delegate to `image-analyzer-subagent` (do not interpret inline).

---

## Discovery Interview Workflow

The `requirements-specialist-subagent` follows this prompt-first flow:

### Step 1: Gather Title & Overview
```
Subagent: "What is the title and brief overview of the feature you want an SRS for?"
User: {provides title and overview}
Subagent: "I'll use: Title: '{title}'. Proceed?"
```

### Step 2: Iterate Through IEEE 830 Parts
```
For each part/section (Introduction → Supporting Information):
  Subagent: "Next: {Section} (e.g. 3.2 Functional Requirements). {Purpose}. What content?"
  User: {provides content or says "skip" — skip keeps the heading}
  Subagent: "Got it. Here's what I'll write: {summary}. Correct?"
```

### Step 3: Confirm Full SRS Before Writing
```
Subagent: "Here's a summary of the SRS:
  - Title: {title}
  - Parts: 1–4 (IEEE 830, with content)
  - File: docs/srs/SRS-draft-{slug}.md

  Proceed to write?"
User: {yes → write file; no → revise}
```

---

## Return Contract

```
**Status:** [success | partial | failed]
**Output:** docs/srs/SRS-draft-{slug}.md
**Summary:** SRS created (IEEE 830) across 4 parts; written to docs/srs/
**Issues:** [blockers or "None"]
```
