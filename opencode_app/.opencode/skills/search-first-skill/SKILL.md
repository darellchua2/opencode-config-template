## What I do

I systematize the "search for existing solutions before implementing" workflow:

1. **Need Analysis**: Define what functionality is needed and identify constraints
2. **Parallel Search**: Search local codebase, package registries, and web simultaneously
3. **Evaluate Options**: Score candidates against quality criteria
4. **Decide**: Choose a strategy using the Adopt / Extend / Compose / Build matrix
5. **Implement**: Apply the chosen strategy with minimal custom code

## When to use me

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new feature that likely has existing solutions
- Adding a dependency or integration
- About to write a utility, helper, or abstraction from scratch
- Unsure whether to use a library or build custom
- Evaluating competing libraries for the same purpose

**Trigger phrases**:
- "search first"
- "research before coding"
- "does this already exist"
- "find existing solution"
- "should I build or use a library"
- "what library should I use for"

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Need Analysis

Define what you're looking for before searching:

- **Functionality**: What exactly must the solution do?
- **Language / Framework**: What are the constraints?
- **License**: MIT / Apache / GPL — any restrictions?
- **Maintenance**: Active maintenance required? Minimum stars/downloads?
- **Integration**: Must work with existing stack (e.g., React 19, Python 3.12)

### Step 2: Parallel Search

Search multiple channels simultaneously:

#### Local Codebase (Search what you already have)

| Tool | When to Use | What It Finds |
|------|------------|---------------|
| `codegraph_search` | Symbol lookup | Existing functions, classes, modules |
| `codegraph_files` | File structure | Related files and modules |
| `codegraph_explore` | Deep exploration | Implementation patterns and relationships |
| `grep` | Text search | Usage patterns, imports, config |
| `glob` | File patterns | Existing implementations by name |

#### Package Ecosystem (Search registries)

| Channel | How to Search | When |
|---------|-------------|------|
| npm (`webfetch` → npmjs.com) | Node.js / TypeScript packages | Frontend or Node backend |
| PyPI (`webfetch` → pypi.org) | Python packages | Python backend, ML, data |
| Go packages (`webfetch` → pkg.go.dev) | Go modules | Go microservices |
| crates.io (`webfetch` → crates.io) | Rust crates | Rust projects |
| Maven Central (`webfetch` → search.maven.org) | Java libraries | Java / Spring projects |

#### Web / Documentation (Search knowledge)

| Tool | When to Use | What It Finds |
|------|------------|---------------|
| `webfetch` (primary) | Documentation, blog posts, comparisons | Best practices, recommendations |
| `zai-web-reader` (fallback) | Large pages, complex content | Detailed docs, API references |

### Step 3: Evaluate Options

Score each candidate against these criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Questions |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Functionality** | High | Does it do exactly what's needed? |
| **Maintenance** | High | Last commit date? Release frequency? |
| **Community** | Medium | Stars, downloads, issue response time? |
| **Documentation** | Medium | Is the API well-documented? Examples? |
| **License** | High | Compatible with project license? |
| **Dependencies** | Medium | Does it pull in a large dependency tree? |
| **Bundle size** | Low (frontend) | Impact on bundle size? |
| **Performance** | Medium | Benchmarks? Known performance issues? |

Scoring: Rate each criterion 1-5, multiply by weight, sum for total score.

### Step 4: Decision Matrix

Use the search results to decide:

| Signal | Strategy | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Exact match, well-maintained, compatible license | **Adopt** | Install and use directly — zero custom code |
| Partial match, good foundation | **Extend** | Install + write thin wrapper for missing pieces |
| Multiple weak matches, none complete | **Compose** | Combine 2-3 small, focused packages |
| Nothing suitable found | **Build** | Write custom, but informed by research |

#### Adopt Criteria
- Covers >90% of requirements
- Active maintenance (commits in last 3 months)
- Compatible license (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD)
- Good documentation with examples
- Reasonable dependency count

#### Extend Criteria
- Covers 60-90% of requirements
- Good foundation but missing edge cases
- Extensible API (plugins, hooks, middleware)
- Adding missing pieces requires <50 lines of wrapper code

#### Compose Criteria
- No single package covers the need
- 2-3 small packages cover different aspects
- Packages are complementary, not overlapping
- Total dependency count stays reasonable

#### Build Criteria
- No existing solution meets requirements
- Requirements are highly specific to this project
- The problem domain is narrow enough for focused implementation
- Research informed the design (you know what exists and why it doesn't fit)

### Step 5: Implement

Apply the chosen strategy:

1. **Adopt**: Install package, configure, write integration code
2. **Extend**: Install package, write wrapper module, add missing functionality
3. **Compose**: Install 2-3 packages, write orchestration layer
4. **Build**: Write implementation informed by research findings

In all cases, document the decision and rationale in code comments or architecture notes.

## Search Strategies by Category

### Development Tooling
- Linting → eslint, ruff, textlint, markdownlint
- Formatting → prettier, black, gofmt
- Testing → jest, pytest, go test, vitest
- Pre-commit → husky, lint-staged, pre-commit

### AI / LLM Integration
- Embeddings → Check for existing MCP servers first
- Document processing → pdfplumber, mammoth, unstructured
- Vector search → Check for existing MCP servers first

### Data & APIs
- HTTP clients → httpx (Python), undici (Node)
- Validation → zod (TS), pydantic (Python)
- Database → Check for existing MCP servers first

### Content & Publishing
- Markdown processing → remark, unified, markdown-it
- Image optimization → sharp, imagemagick

### Always Check First
- Local codebase (`codegraph_search`, `grep`) — you may already have it
- MCP servers in config — tools may already be available
- Existing skills — domain knowledge may already exist

## Execution Modes

### Quick Mode (Inline)

For small decisions that take <5 minutes of research:

1. Does this already exist in the repo? → `grep` / `codegraph_search` relevant modules
2. Is there a well-known package? → Quick registry search
3. Is there an MCP server for this? → Check MCP config
4. Decision: Adopt / Build with minimal overhead

### Full Mode (Agent Delegation)

For non-trivial functionality, delegate research to an explore subagent:

```
Task tool with subagent_type="explore"
Prompt: "Research existing tools for: [DESCRIPTION]
Language/framework: [LANG]
Constraints: [ANY]

Search: package registries, MCP servers, existing skills, web
Return: Structured comparison with recommendation"
```

If CodeGraph is available (`.codegraph/` exists in project), include CodeGraph guidance in the Task prompt so the explore subagent uses graph-based search alongside package/web search.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Jumping to code** | Writing a utility without checking if one exists | Always search first, even for small helpers |
| **Ignoring MCP** | Not checking if an MCP server already provides the capability | Check MCP config before writing integration code |
| **Silent skipping** | Reporting "nothing found" when a search channel was unavailable | Honestly report which channels were searched and which were skipped |
| **Over-customizing** | Wrapping a library so heavily it loses its benefits | Use the library's API directly; only wrap when adding real value |
| **Dependency bloat** | Installing a massive package for one small feature | Prefer small, focused packages or building the narrow feature |
| **NIH syndrome** | Building from scratch because "it's simple" | Even simple features benefit from battle-tested libraries |
| **Analysis paralysis** | Spending more time searching than it would take to build | Use quick mode for trivial decisions; full mode for significant ones |

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Integration |
|-------|-------------|
| `continuous-learning-skill` | Store search decisions as reusable patterns (e.g., "for HTTP retries, use got") |
| `architecture-review-subagent` | Architect consults search-first for technology stack decisions |
| `strategic-compact-skill` | Compact preserves search decisions and rationale for future sessions |
| `eval-harness-skill` | Evaluate whether the chosen library/solution meets quality thresholds |
| `context-budget-skill` | Budget audit catches dependency bloat from over-installing packages |

## Best Practices

### When to Skip Search
- The functionality is truly unique to your domain
- You're fixing a bug in existing code (search won't help)
- The task is a one-line config change
- You already know the exact library and version to use

### When to Insist on Search
- Adding a new dependency to the project
- Building a utility that seems "common" (dates, strings, validation)
- Implementing a pattern that exists in well-known libraries
- Starting a new module or service

### Search Efficiency
- Start local (codebase) before going external (registries, web)
- Use CodeGraph for fast symbol lookup before grep/glob chains
- Use `webfetch` as primary web tool; `zai-web-reader` only as fallback
- Set a time budget: 5 min for quick decisions, 20 min for major choices

### Documenting Decisions
After completing a search-first workflow, document:
- What was searched (channels, queries)
- What was found (candidates, scores)
- What was decided (strategy, rationale)
- What was the result (package installed / code written)

This creates a searchable trail for future decisions.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: "Add dead link checking"

```
Need: Check markdown files for broken links
Search: npmjs.com "markdown dead link checker"
Found: textlint-rule-no-dead-link (score: 9/10)
Decision: ADOPT — npm install textlint-rule-no-dead-link
Result: Zero custom code, battle-tested solution
```

### Example 2: "Add HTTP client wrapper"

```
Need: Resilient HTTP client with retries and timeout handling
Search: Local codebase first → no existing client
Search: npmjs.com "http client retry" / PyPI "httpx retry"
Found: got (Node) with retry plugin, httpx (Python) with built-in retry
Decision: ADOPT — use got/httpx directly with retry config
Result: Zero custom code, production-proven libraries
```

### Example 3: "Add config file linter"

```
Need: Validate project config files against a schema
Search: npmjs.com "config linter schema", "json schema validator cli"
Found: ajv-cli (score: 8/10) — validates JSON/YAML against JSON Schema
Decision: ADOPT + EXTEND — install ajv-cli, write project-specific schemas
Result: 1 package + 1 schema file, no custom validation logic
```

### Example 4: "Add rate limiting to API"

```
Need: Rate limiting middleware for Express/FastAPI
Search: Local codebase → rate-limiter already exists but unused
Search: npmjs.com → express-rate-limit (popular, maintained)
Decision: ADOPT existing local code first, then evaluate npm package if needed
Result: Reused existing implementation, avoided duplicate dependency
```
