## What I do

I provide intelligent GitHub issue label assessment by:

- Analyzing issue content to determine appropriate labels
- Using keyword and pattern matching to identify issue types and priorities
- Assigning single or multiple labels based on issue complexity
- **Auto-creating missing labels** before assignment (never fails on missing labels)
- Providing label descriptions for clarity and consistency

## When to use me

Use this when:
- You need to assess and label GitHub issues automatically
- You want consistent label assignment across your repository
- You need to categorize issues using GitHub's default label scheme
- You're setting up a new repository and need label guidelines
- You want to review unlabeled or mislabeled issues
- You need to assign semantic versioning labels to pull requests

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Git repository with GitHub remote
- Write access to the GitHub repository
- Valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh` authentication setup

## Governance

The semantic versioning label definitions below follow `semantic-release-convention`, which is the single source of truth for version bump conventions across all skills and agents.

For JIRA ticket type and priority mapping, see `jira-ticket-labeler-skill` — a separate skill for JIRA-specific taxonomy.

## Label Taxonomy

### Issue Labels vs PR Labels

| Context | Label Set | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| GitHub Issues | Type labels + Priority labels | Categorize and triage issues |
| GitHub PRs | Semver labels (major, minor, patch) | Determine version bump for release |

Issues get type + priority labels. PRs get exactly one semver label. These are distinct concerns.

### Label Categories

#### 1. Type Labels (GitHub Issues)

| Label | Color | Hex | Description |
|-------|-------|-----|-------------|
| `bug` | Red | #d73a4a | Something isn't working as expected |
| `enhancement` | Light blue | #a2eeef | New feature or improvement |
| `documentation` | Blue | #0075ca | Documentation improvements |
| `duplicate` | Gray | #cfd3d7 | Already exists |
| `good first issue` | Green | #7057ff | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | Purple | #008672 | Extra attention needed |
| `invalid` | Yellow | #e4e669 | Not a valid issue |
| `question` | Purple | #d876e3 | Clarification needed |
| `wontfix` | White | #ffffff | Will not be worked on |

#### 2. Priority Labels (GitHub Issues)

| Label | Color | Hex | Description |
|-------|-------|-----|-------------|
| `priority: critical` | Red | #b60205 | System down, data loss, security vulnerability |
| `priority: high` | Orange | #d93f0b | Major feature broken, significant user impact |
| `priority: medium` | Yellow | #fbca04 | Functional issue with workaround |
| `priority: low` | Green | #0e8a16 | Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue |

#### 3. Semver Labels (GitHub PRs)

| Label | Color | Hex | Version Bump | When to Apply |
|-------|-------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| `major` | Red | #d73a4a | X.0.0 | Breaking changes |
| `minor` | Yellow | #fbca04 | 0.X.0 | New features |
| `patch` | Green | #0e8a16 | 0.0.X | Bug fixes, docs, refactoring |

## Steps

### Step 1: Auto-Create Missing Labels

Before any label assignment, ensure all required labels exist. This `LABELS` array is the single **machine-readable** source for label colors/descriptions; the Label Taxonomy tables above (§ Label Categories) are the single **human-readable** source.

```bash
declare -A LABELS=(
  ["bug"]="d73a4a,Something isn't working"
  ["enhancement"]="a2eeef,New feature or request"
  ["documentation"]="0075ca,Improvements or additions to documentation"
  ["duplicate"]="cfd3d7,This issue or pull request already exists"
  ["good first issue"]="7057ff,Good for newcomers"
  ["help wanted"]="008672,Extra attention is needed"
  ["invalid"]="e4e669,This doesn't seem right"
  ["question"]="d876e3,Further information is requested"
  ["wontfix"]="ffffff,This will not be worked on"
  ["priority: critical"]="b60205,System down, data loss, security vulnerability"
  ["priority: high"]="d93f0b,Major feature broken, significant user impact"
  ["priority: medium"]="fbca04,Functional issue with workaround"
  ["priority: low"]="0e8a16,Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue"
  ["major"]="d73a4a,Breaking change (X.0.0)"
  ["minor"]="fbca04,New feature (0.X.0)"
  ["patch"]="0e8a16,Bug fix (0.0.X)"
)

existing_labels=$(gh label list --json name --jq '.[].name')

for label in "${!LABELS[@]}"; do
  if ! echo "$existing_labels" | grep -qx "$label"; then
    IFS=',' read -r color desc <<< "${LABELS[$label]}"
    gh label create "$label" --color "$color" --description "$desc" 2>/dev/null || true
  fi
done
```

### Step 2: Analyze Issue Content

```bash
gh issue view <issue-number> --json title,body,labels

issue_title=$(gh issue view <issue-number> --jq '.title')
issue_body=$(gh issue view <issue-number> --jq '.body')
issue_content="${title} ${body}"
```

### Step 3: Determine Appropriate Labels

> **Sync Contract**: The priority keyword tables below are mirrored in `jira-ticket-labeler-skill`. When updating one, update both.

> These keywords are intent signals, not literal substring matches. Apply semantic judgment — "add" in "address" does not indicate an enhancement.

#### Type Detection

**Bug** — Keywords: fix, error, broken, crash, fail, doesn't work, incorrect, wrong, problem, bug, defect, regression
Examples:
- "Login button does nothing when clicked"
- "Regression: export stopped working after the last release"

**Enhancement** — Keywords: add, implement, create, new, feature, support, introduce, build, develop, request, suggestion
Examples:
- "Add a dark mode toggle to settings"
- "Implement CSV export for reports"

**Documentation** — Keywords: document, readme, docs, guide, explain, tutorial, wiki, comment, manual, help
Examples:
- "README is missing installation steps"
- "Add a guide for the new config format"

**Duplicate** — Keywords: duplicate, same as, already exists, similar, repeated, already reported
Examples:
- "Same as #123 — login fails on mobile"
- "This looks like an already-reported crash"

**Good First Issue** — Keywords: beginner, simple, easy, small, straightforward, first time, newcomer, junior
Examples:
- "Simple typo in the error message"
- "Straightforward label rename for a newcomer"

**Help Wanted** — Keywords: help wanted, need help, assistance, looking for help, collaboration, community
Examples:
- "Help wanted: port this to Linux ARM"
- "Looking for help testing on Safari"

**Invalid** — Keywords: invalid, not an issue, wrong repo, user error, configuration, misunderstanding
Examples:
- "Not an issue — resolved after clearing cache"
- "Wrong repo — this belongs in the SDK project"

**Question** — Keywords: question, how, what, why, clarification, explain, understand, ask, wondering
Examples:
- "How do I configure retries?"
- "Why does the build cache locally?"

**Wontfix** — Keywords: wontfix, out of scope, not feasible, declined, rejected, wont do, never
Examples:
- "Out of scope for this milestone"
- "Declined — covered by the new architecture"

#### Priority Detection

**Critical** — Keywords: critical, urgent, system down, data loss, security, vulnerability, outage, production down
Examples:
- "Production is down — all logins failing"
- "Possible data loss during failover"

**High** — Keywords: high priority, important, blocking, broken, unusable, regression
Examples:
- "Core checkout flow is broken for all users"
- "Blocking our release — regression in payments"

**Medium** (default if no other priority detected) — Keywords: medium, moderate, workaround, intermittent
Examples:
- "Intermittent timeout on the dashboard"
- "Has a workaround but still annoying"

**Low** — Keywords: low priority, minor, cosmetic, nice to have, nit, typo, whenever
Examples:
- "Cosmetic: misaligned icon on profile page"
- "Minor typo in the footer text"

#### Semver Label Detection (PRs only)

Applied to pull requests, not issues. See `semantic-release-convention` for the governance spec.

```bash
if [[ "$pr_title" =~ ^[^:]+\! ]]; then
  labels+=("major")
elif [[ "$pr_title" =~ ^feat ]]; then
  labels+=("minor")
else
  labels+=("patch")
fi
```

> The semver PR-title rule above is **structural** — it inspects the Conventional Commit prefix of `$pr_title`, not issue content. It is intentionally kept as code and excluded from the keyword-list conversion.

### Step 4: Assign Labels

```bash
for label in "${labels[@]}"; do
  gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "$label"
done
```

### Step 5: Generate Assessment Report

```markdown
# Issue Label Assessment

**Issue**: #<issue-number> - <issue-title>
**Assigned Labels**:
- `<label1>`: <label description>
- `<label2>`: <label description>

**Detection Keywords**:
- `<keyword1>` → `<label1>`
- `<keyword2>` → `<label2>`

**Confidence**: High/Medium/Low

**Recommendations**:
- Additional labels to consider
- Labels to review
- Notes on ambiguous cases
```

## Best Practices

### Label Assignment

- **Start with type label**: Assign bug or enhancement first
- **Add exactly one priority**: Every issue should have a priority
- **Maximum 3 labels**: Type + Priority + one auxiliary (good first issue, help wanted, etc.)
- **Be consistent**: Use same labels for similar issues
- **Review existing labels**: Check issue history before assigning new labels

### Content Analysis

- **Analyze both title and body**: Keywords can appear in either
- **Consider context**: Same keyword may indicate different label based on context
- **Look for explicit requests**: "Please add" vs "How to add"
- **Check for negations**: "not a bug" should not be labeled as bug
- **Review issue comments**: Comments may provide additional context

## Common Issues

### Label Doesn't Exist

**Solution**: Auto-create is built into Step 1. Labels are created before assignment. If `gh label create` fails (e.g., label already exists), the error is silently ignored via `|| true`.

### Conflicting Labels

**Issue**: Issue is assigned both "bug" and "enhancement"

**Solution**:
- Review the issue content carefully
- Determine primary intent: fix vs new feature
- Remove the conflicting label
- Add a comment explaining the decision

### Low Confidence Assignment

**Solution**:
- Leave unlabeled or use generic label like "enhancement"
- Add comment requesting clarification from issue author
- Manual review by maintainer

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Verify issue has labels
gh issue view <issue-number> --jq '.labels[].name'

# 2. Check label count
label_count=$(gh issue view <issue-number> --jq '.labels | length')
echo "Issue has $label_count label(s)"

# 3. Validate labels exist in repository
for label in $(gh issue view <issue-number> --jq '.labels[].name'); do
  if gh label list --search "$label" --jq 'any(.name == "'"$label"'")' | grep -q "true"; then
    echo "OK Label '$label' exists"
  else
    echo "MISSING Label '$label' does not exist"
  fi
done
```

## Automation Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# End-to-end loop: auto-create labels (Step 1), then detect + assign for all
# unlabeled open issues (Steps 2-4). This composes the steps above; it does NOT
# redeclare the label data.

# Step 1: Ensure all labels exist — run the LABELS create loop from Step 1
#         (single machine-readable source; omitted here for brevity).

# Steps 2-4: Assess every open, unlabeled issue
for issue_number in $(gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --jq '.[].number'); do
  labels=$(gh issue view "$issue_number" --jq '.labels | length')

  if [ "$labels" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Assessing issue #$issue_number..."

    title=$(gh issue view "$issue_number" --jq '.title')
    body=$(gh issue view "$issue_number" --jq '.body')
    content="${title} ${body}"

    assign_labels=()

    # Step 3 (Type): apply the Type Detection keyword rules with semantic judgment.
    # Pick the best-fitting type label(s): bug / enhancement / documentation / ...

    # Step 3 (Priority): pick exactly one priority; default to priority: medium.
    #   matches Critical -> priority: critical
    #   matches High     -> priority: high
    #   matches Low      -> priority: low
    #   otherwise        -> priority: medium
    assign_labels+=("priority: medium")  # adjust per the rules above

    # Step 4: Assign
    if [ ${#assign_labels[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
      label_string=$(IFS=,; echo "${assign_labels[*]}")
      gh issue edit "$issue_number" --add-label "$label_string"
      echo "OK Assigned: $label_string"
    else
      echo "? Could not determine label for #$issue_number"
    fi
  fi
done
```
