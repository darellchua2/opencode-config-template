## What I do

I help you apply SOLID principles to write maintainable, flexible, and testable code:

1. **Analyze Code Structure**: Evaluate classes, modules, and functions for SOLID compliance
2. **Detect Violations**: Identify which SOLID principle is being violated with specific examples
3. **Provide Refactoring Guidance**: Suggest concrete fixes with before/after code examples
4. **Apply at Multiple Levels**: From class-level to architecture-level SOLID application
5. **Create Detection Questions**: Provide questions to ask when reviewing code
6. **Generate Quick Reference**: Create lookup tables for rapid SOLID assessment

## When to use me

Use this skill when:
- Writing new code and want to ensure SOLID compliance from the start
- Refactoring existing code that feels "wrong" or hard to change
- Reviewing code (peer review, PR review) for quality issues
- Teaching or learning SOLID principles with practical examples
- Diagnosing why a particular class or module is difficult to maintain
- Planning architecture and want SOLID at the system level
- Setting up coding standards for a team or project

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic object-oriented programming concepts
- Code to analyze (existing or being written)
- Willingness to refactor and improve code quality
- Basic knowledge of dependency injection and interfaces

## SOLID Principles Overview

SOLID helps structure software to be flexible, maintainable, and testable. These principles reduce coupling and increase cohesion.

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."

### Problem It Solves
God objects that do everything - hard to test, hard to change, hard to understand.

### How to Apply
Each class handles ONE responsibility. If you find yourself saying "and" when describing what a class does, split it.

**Language-Agnostic Example:**

```python
# BAD: Multiple responsibilities
class Order:
    def calculate_total(self): ...
    def save_to_database(self): ...    # Persistence
    def generate_invoice(self): ...    # Presentation
```

```typescript
// GOOD: Single responsibility each
class Order {
    addItem(item) { ... }
    calculateTotal() { ... }
}

class OrderRepository {
    save(order) { ... }
}

class InvoiceGenerator {
    generate(order) { ... }
}
```

### Detection Questions
- Does this class have multiple reasons to change?
- Can I describe it without using "and"?
- Would different stakeholders request changes to different parts?

---

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."

### Problem It Solves
Having to modify existing, tested code every time requirements change. Risk of breaking working features.

### How to Apply
Design abstractions that allow new behavior through new classes, not edits to existing ones.

**Language-Agnostic Example:**

```python
# BAD: Must modify to add new shipping
class ShippingCalculator:
    def calculate(self, type, value):
        if type == 'standard': return 5 if value < 50 else 0
        if type == 'express': return 15
        # Must add more ifs for new types!
```

```typescript
// GOOD: Open for extension
interface ShippingMethod {
    calculateCost(orderValue: number): number;
}

class StandardShipping implements ShippingMethod {
    calculateCost(orderValue: number) {
        return orderValue < 50 ? 5 : 0;
    }
}

class ExpressShipping implements ShippingMethod {
    calculateCost(orderValue: number) {
        return 15;
    }
}

// Add new shipping by creating new class, not modifying existing
class SameDayShipping implements ShippingMethod {
    calculateCost(orderValue: number) {
        return 25;
    }
}
```

### Architectural Insight
OCP at architecture level means: **design your codebase so new features are added by adding code, not changing existing code.**

---

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness."

### Problem It Solves
Subclasses that break expectations, requiring type-checking and special cases.

### How to Apply
Subclasses must honor the contract of the parent. If the parent returns positive numbers, subclasses cannot return negatives.

**Language-Agnostic Example:**

```python
# BAD: Violates parent's contract
class DiscountPolicy:
    def get_discount(self, value):
        return 0  # Non-negative expected

class WeirdDiscount(DiscountPolicy):
    def get_discount(self, value):
        return -5  # Increases cost! Breaks expectations
```

```typescript
// GOOD: Enforces contract
class DiscountPolicy {
    constructor(private discount: number) {
        if (discount < 0) throw new Error("Discount must be non-negative");
    }

    getDiscount(): number {
        return this.discount;
    }
}
```

### Key Insight
This is why you can swap `InMemoryUserRepo` for `PostgresUserRepo` - they both honor the `UserRepo` interface contract.

---

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> "Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use."

### Problem It Solves
Fat interfaces that force partial implementations, empty methods, or throws.

### How to Apply
Split large interfaces into smaller, cohesive ones. Clients depend only on what they need.

**Language-Agnostic Example:**

```python
# BAD: Fat interface
class WarehouseDevice:
    def print_label(self, order_id): ...
    def scan_barcode(self): ...
    def package_item(self, order_id): ...

class BasicPrinter(WarehouseDevice):
    def print_label(self, order_id): ...  # works
    def scan_barcode(self): raise NotImplementedError  # Forced!
    def package_item(self, order_id): raise NotImplementedError  # Forced!
```

```typescript
// GOOD: Segregated interfaces
interface LabelPrinter {
    printLabel(orderId: string): void;
}

interface BarcodeScanner {
    scanBarcode(): string;
}

interface ItemPackager {
    packageItem(orderId: string): void;
}

class BasicPrinter implements LabelPrinter {
    printLabel(orderId: string) { /* only what it does */ }
}
```

### Detection
If you see `throw new Error("Not implemented")` or empty method bodies, the interface is too fat.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."

### Problem It Solves
Tight coupling to specific implementations (databases, APIs, frameworks). Hard to test, hard to swap.

### How to Apply
Depend on interfaces, inject implementations.

**Language-Agnostic Example:**

```python
# BAD: Direct dependency on concrete class
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email_service = SendGridEmailService()  # Locked in!
    
    def confirm_order(self, email):
        self.email_service.send(email, "Order confirmed")
```

```typescript
// GOOD: Depend on abstraction
interface EmailService {
    send(to: string, message: string): void;
}

class OrderService {
    constructor(private emailService: EmailService) {}
    
    confirmOrder(email: string) {
        this.emailService.send(email, "Order confirmed");
    }
}

// Now can inject any implementation
new OrderService(new SendGridEmailService());
new OrderService(new SESEmailService());
new OrderService(new MockEmailService());  // For tests!
```

### The Dependency Rule
Source code dependencies should point **inward** toward high-level policies (domain logic), never toward low-level details (infrastructure).

```
Infrastructure → Application → Domain
      ↓              ↓            ↓
    (outer)       (middle)     (inner)

Dependencies flow: outer → inner
Never: inner → outer
```

## Applying SOLID at Architecture Level

These principles scale beyond classes:

| Principle | Architecture Application |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| SRP | Each bounded context has one responsibility |
| OCP | New features = new modules, not edits to existing |
| LSP | Microservices with same contract are substitutable |
| ISP | Thin interfaces between services |
| DIP | High-level business logic doesn't know about databases/frameworks |

---

## Quick Reference

| Principle | One-Liner | Red Flag |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| SRP | One reason to change | "This class handles X and Y and Z" |
| OCP | Add, don't modify | `if/else` chains for types |
| LSP | Subtypes are substitutable | Type-checking in calling code |
| ISP | Small, focused interfaces | Empty method implementations |
| DIP | Depend on abstractions | `new ConcreteClass()` in business logic |

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Principle Being Violated

Use the Quick Reference table to identify which principle is causing issues:

1. Read the code in question
2. Check for red flags in the table
3. Identify the most likely violated principle
4. Proceed to the specific principle section for detailed guidance

### Step 2: Apply the Appropriate Refactoring

For each violated principle:

**SRP Violations:**
1. Identify all responsibilities (use "and" test)
2. Create separate classes for each responsibility
3. Use composition to combine if needed
4. Verify each class has one reason to change

**OCP Violations:**
1. Identify the variation point (what keeps changing)
2. Create an interface for the varying behavior
3. Implement the interface for each variation
4. Use dependency injection to select implementation

**LSP Violations:**
1. Document the parent's contract explicitly
2. Ensure all subclasses honor the contract
3. Add preconditions/postconditions if needed
4. Remove or fix violating subclasses

**ISP Violations:**
1. Identify which clients use which methods
2. Group methods by client usage
3. Create smaller, focused interfaces
4. Have classes implement only needed interfaces

**DIP Violations:**
1. Identify concrete dependencies in high-level modules
2. Create interfaces for those dependencies
3. Move interfaces to the high-level module
4. Inject implementations via constructor/method

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

After refactoring:

1. Run all tests to ensure behavior is preserved
2. Check that the red flag is eliminated
3. Verify the code is easier to change
4. Confirm no new violations introduced

## Best Practices

### General SOLID Practices

- **Start with SRP**: It's the easiest to understand and apply
- **Use interfaces liberally**: They enable OCP, ISP, and DIP
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**: Reduces LSP issues
- **Inject dependencies**: Enables DIP and testability
- **Keep interfaces small**: Follows ISP naturally
- **Review in pairs**: Fresh eyes catch violations

### Language-Specific Tips

**Python:**
- Use `abc.ABC` for interfaces
- Use dependency injection frameworks like `injector`
- Duck typing still needs clear contracts

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
- Use `interface` for contracts
- Use IoC containers like InversifyJS
- TypeScript makes DIP much easier

**Java/C#:**
- Use dependency injection containers (Spring, .NET DI)
- Favour interface over abstract class
- Use partial classes to split large classes

---

## Common Issues

### Over-Engineering with SOLID

**Issue**: Creating too many small classes/interfaces for simple problems

**Solution**:
- Apply SOLID when you feel pain, not preemptively
- Start simple, refactor when needed
- The Rule of Three applies to abstractions too

### SOLID Conflicts

**Issue**: Applying one principle seems to violate another

**Solution**:
- SRP and OCP often feel conflicting
- Priority: SRP > DIP > OCP > ISP > LSP
- Balance principles based on context

### Legacy Code

**Issue**: Hard to apply SOLID to existing tightly-coupled code

**Solution**:
- Start with DIP (extract interfaces)
- Then apply ISP (split interfaces)
- Then SRP (split classes)
- Work incrementally, not all at once

---

## Verification Commands

After applying SOLID principles:

```bash
# Check class sizes (large classes may violate SRP)
find src -name "*.ts" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | head -20

# Check for concrete instantiations (may violate DIP)
grep -r "new [A-Z]" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "test"

# Check for large interfaces (may violate ISP)
grep -r "interface" src/ --include="*.ts" -A 20 | grep -c "^\s*[a-z]"
```

**SOLID Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Each class has one responsibility (SRP)
- [ ] New features don't require modifying existing code (OCP)
- [ ] Subclasses are substitutable for parents (LSP)
- [ ] No client depends on unused methods (ISP)
- [ ] High-level modules depend on abstractions (DIP)
- [ ] All tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] Code is easier to change than before
