## What I do

- Guide you through linting Python code using Ruff linter with industry standard practices
- Detect if Poetry is installed and use `poetry run ruff check .` for linting
- Use `poetry run ruff check . --fix` to automatically fix linting errors
- Provide guidance on interpreting and fixing Ruff linting issues
- Ensure Python code follows PEP 8 and other industry standard practices
- Configure Ruff settings for consistent code style across the project

## When to use me

Use this when:
- Writing or modifying Python code that needs to follow industry standards
- Before committing Python changes to ensure code quality
- When you see Ruff linting errors and need help fixing them
- Setting up a new Python project with proper linting configuration

Ask clarifying questions if the Poetry environment is not detected or if you need help with specific Ruff rules.
